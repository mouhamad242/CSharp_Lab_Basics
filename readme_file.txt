# CSharp Lab Basics
This project is a C# console application for learning the basics of C# programming. It includes tasks such as:
- Input validation for low and high numbers.
- Writing numbers to a file in reverse order.
- Reading numbers from the file and calculating their sum.

   - The low number is positive.
   - The high number is greater than the low number.
2. Writes all numbers between the low and high numbers to a file (`numbers.txt`) in reverse order.
3. Reads numbers from the file and calculates their sum.
4. Finds and prints all prime numbers between the low and high values.
